# DotnetAPI

This is an set of APIs that have functioning authentication and account management. There are also features to create "posts" that can be modified as well. This API is a foundation for any type of social media site or blog website that may need to store user created posts.
This project has been refactored using stored procedures to make the endpoints much more modular and condensed. I built this while following this Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/net-core-with-ms-sql-beginner-to-expert/.
